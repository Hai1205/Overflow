# Overflow

## Introduction

Overflow is a small web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user clicks the "Click here" button, the page plays music and displays a series of notifications on the screen, creating a "memory overflow" effect. After the effect finishes, a special message appears in the center of the screen with animated text and a link to redirect to another page.

## Features

- Simple and user-friendly interface.
- Random notifications appear on the screen.
- Music plays when the button is clicked.
- Animated text effect for the final message.
- Redirects to another page when clicking the final message.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click the **"Click here"** button to start the effect and play music.
3. After the effect ends, click the displayed message to go to the next page.
